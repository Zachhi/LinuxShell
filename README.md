# LinuxShell

My implementation of a linux shell

Shell has the ability to function almost as much as the linux/ubuntu shell in your OS, which lets a user navigate through the file system and perform a wide variety of tasks using a series of easy to remember and simple commands.

### Types of Instructions

1. A-Instruction: Addressing instructions, used with a preceding `@`
2. C-Instruction: Computation instructions, used with either `=` or `;`
3. L-Instruction: Labels (Symbols) declaration instructions, used with `(symbol)`

### Dependencies

* Some way to compile and execute c++ code
* GNU Make (Not required, but makes executing easier)

### Installing and Executing

* Download the source code from github, or clone the repository into Visual Studio
* Type `make` and then execute `/run`
* You will want to do this in a virtual enviroment if you edit the files, otherwise you may compromise your computers health
